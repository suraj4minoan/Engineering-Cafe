## Dynamic Styling in Angular: Using ngClass and ngStyle

Dynamic styling is a powerful feature in Angular that allows you to apply styles conditionally based on component state or data. In this post, we’ll explore how to use `ngClass` and `ngStyle` to enhance your Angular applications with responsive and interactive designs.

### What Are ngClass and ngStyle?

- **ngClass**: This directive allows you to add or remove CSS classes dynamically based on conditions. It can take a string, an array, or an object to define the classes to be applied.

- **ngStyle**: This directive lets you set inline styles dynamically. You can bind an object to it where the keys are CSS properties and the values are the corresponding styles.

### Setting Up Your Angular Project

If you don’t have an Angular project set up, you can create one using the Angular CLI:

```bash
ng new dynamic-styling-example
cd dynamic-styling-example
ng serve
```
<div style="position: relative; width: 100%; padding-bottom: 56.25%">
<iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/jgEYn-ldr30" 
        title="Web Load Testing with West Wind WebSurge 2" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen
        allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" 
        style="position: absolute; width: 100%; height: 100%;">
</iframe>
</div>
